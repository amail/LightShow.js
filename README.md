============

LightShow is a JavaScript/JQuery plugin that helps you create amazingly simple overlays. Designed to be flexible and easy to use.

## Features

* Overlay the whole document or a specific element.
* No external CSS file needed. But still easy to style.
* Auto adjusts itself on window resize. Possible to manually adjust element (e.g. during animation, see: readapt).
* Positioning. Position the content relative to the overlay according to directions (e.g. top center, middle center, bottom left, a.s.o.).
* Effects. Use standard JQuery effects (toggle, fade, slide) or use your own.
* Hover activation. Show/hide overlay on element hover.
* Callbacks. Hook in when events occur.
* Close overlay using escape key.

## Usage

### Instantiation

	var overlay = $.lightShow({options});
	
*Notice: The instance returned is not a JQuery object.*
	
### Identity lookup

	var overlay = $.lightShow("lightshow-id");
	
### Method chaining (fluent interface)

	$.lightShow("lightshow-id").show().setContent("<h1>YUP WE'RE SETTING IT!!!!!</h1>").hide();

## Options

### Id

String identity of this instance.

	id: "login"

 This means that if identity is 'login' then the instance is accessible by using:
 
	$.lightShow('login').show();
	
### Overlay

The object that you want to overlay. Can be either document (default) or a specific element.

	overlay: 'document' // Default is 'document'
===================
	overlay: $("#element-to-overlay")
	
### Content

Content that you want to place inside your overlay. This can be either a string (HTML) or an element, i.e.

	content: "<h1>My amazing content that I want in my overlay!</h1>"
===========================
	content: $("#element-to-use-as-content")

### Show on startup

Whether or not to run show() directly after initialization.

	showOnStartup: true // Default is false

Enabling this option is equal to doing the following:

	$.lightShow({/*options...*/}).show();
	
### Show on overlay hover

If a specific overlay element is set, then the overlay can be activated (show/hide) on mouse hover.

	showOnHover: true

### Hide button selector

Selector used to identify buttons that close (hide) the overlay.

	hideButtonSelector: ".hide-button" // Default is '.hide-button'
====
This means that using the above selector you can have content with elements that match the specified selector, i.e.

	content: "<h1>Content!</h1><a href='#' class='hide-button'>Close overlay</a>"

### Hide on escape

Enabling this option means that pressing the escape key (ESC) automatically closes (hides) the overlay.

	hideOnEscape: true // Default is true

### Effect

Effects that run when the overlay is showing/hiding.

	effect: {
		type: 'fade', // Default is 'fade', but can also be, 'slide' and 'toggle'
		duration: 500 // Time in milliseconds (ms) that the effect should animate
	}
	
But it is also possible to override the default effects and use your own, i.e.

	effect: {
		show: function(element, complete_callback){
			element.css('display', 'block').zoomIn(500, complete_callback);
		},
		hide: function(element, complete_callback){
			element.zoomOut(500, complete_callback);
		}
	}


### Style

#### Overflow

Decides how content overflow is handled.

	style: {
		overflow: 'hidden', // Default is 'hidden'
	}

#### Opacity

Specifies the overlay opacity. From 0.0 (fully transparent) to 1.0 (fully opaque).

	style: {
		opacity: 0.85, // Default is 0.85
	}

#### Background color

Overlay background color. Note that this color is affected by the overlay opacity.

	style: {
		backgroundColor: "#000" // Default is '#000' (black)
	}
	
## Methods

### show

Shows the overlay and it's content (runs the 'show' animation).

	$.lightShow({/*options...*/}).show();
	
### hide

Hides the overlay and it's content (runs the 'hide' animation).

	$.lightShow({/*options...*/}).hide();
	
### setContent

Sets the content of the overlay. Value is same as the 'content' option, i.e.

	$.lightShow({/*options...*/}).setContent("<h1>My amazing content that I want in my overlay!</h1>");
===========================
	$.lightShow({/*options...*/}).setContent($("#element-to-use-as-content"));

### setEffect

Sets the effect to be used when showing/hiding the overlay. Effects supported are 'fade', 'slide' and 'toggle'.

	$.lightShow({/*options...*/}).setEffect("slide");
===========================
	$.lightShow({/*options...*/}).setEffect("toggle");
	
### readapt

Repositions/dimensions the overlay and it's content. This can be used when you want to do animations on the content and want the overlay to stick with it.

	$("#element-in-overlay-content").animate({
		height: '50%'
	},{
		step: function(now, fx) {
			$.lightShow("my-overlay-id").readapt();
		}
	});
	
### release

Releases/removes all memory/elements associated with this instance. This can be used to clean up overlays.

	var overlay = $.lightShow({/*options...*/}); // Instantiate..
	overlay.release(); // Tell the instance to release all that it has allocated (variables, elements, etc..)
	overlay = null; // Necessary to fully release the object from memory
